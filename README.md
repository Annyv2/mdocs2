#How to run it

In order to run mdocs, all you need to have is NodeJS installed.

If you're running on Linux, I recommend installing NodeJS [Using this](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Once you have it installed, just run the following commands:

````js
npm install
npm start
````

Now go to http://localhost:3000/ and watch the awesomeness work :D.
